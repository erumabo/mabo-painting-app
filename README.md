# Mabo's painting app

A simple painting application for Web and Android,
really simple to just sketch something quick on the go,
tailored to my needs.


## Key notes

- No build steps: this is mean to be a static build-less ES6 website
  , so no NPM, Webpack or any bundlers, loaders, transpilers, etc...,
  the only exception is the .apk that I build using Capacitor.js in a separate env
- Modern browsers: this is a personal project to play with new or less know fratures,
  as such, I won't be checking browser compatibility, if it works on my machine, then it works

## Roadmap

### Next-up

- Separate code in modules
- Add dialog to create a new project, set canvas size
- Ability to rearange the layers


### Latter

- Pencils and patterns
- Rework UI
- Autoscale canvas to screen, and center it
- Color picker with alpha


### Way latter down the road
- Edit history
- Select, copy, cut and paste
- Move layers independently
- Layers of diff size
